there is some debate over which method yields the best results - slow cooking at low heat the entire time, or searing first on high heat and then slow cooking. james beard in his american cookery prefers the slow-cook-low-heat method (he rubs the roast with salt and pepper and cooks it at 325°f the whole time.) 

you will also get great results with the searing method, starting at high heat and then dropping the temp which is the method described in this recipe.

for this roast, pull it out at 130°f if you like it medium rare. as it rests the internal temperature will continue to rise a few points as the meat continues to cook.(i like lamb on the rare side of medium rare, and this roast was perfectly done for me). an accurate meat thermometer is essential. 

the marinade used works quite well, however; a simpler marinade of rosemary, olive oil, garlic, pepper, and lemon juice would do the trick quite nicely too. you can also make tiny slices into the surface of the roast and insert slivers of garlic and herbs if you like.

memphis barbecue sauce is known for its sweet and tangy tomato base. this sauce keeps true to that tradition, striking a perfect balance between the sweet (they use brown and white sugar), the tangy (cider vinegar), and the tomato base (good ole ketchup!). any self-respecting memphis pit master will tell you that the sauce must complement the meat without overpowering it, and theirs does just that.

at the restaurant the sauce is simmered for five hours, and we always taste the blend before cooking it, making sure we’ve got all the ingredients working. over the years, we’ve learned that if it tastes good before it cooks, it’s gonna be outstanding after a long, slow simmer. the end result: an insanely thick, rich, and sweet sauce, and the perfect adornment for any rack anywhere.

note:

we never salt our barbecue sauce because of the sodium content in the ketchup and because other ingredients like onion powder and worcestershire sauce provide so much flavor. since our sauce is mostly used on grilled items (that are seasoned) and combined with other foods (like barbecue spaghetti and molasses-baked beans), we don’t want to end up with food that is too salty. so we err on the side of slightly underseasoning this sauce (although believe me, no one ever says that it lacks flavor). if your taste buds yearn for a little more salt, you can season the sauce–at the end of the cooking time–as you please.","['ketchup', 'water', 'light-brown sugar', 'granulated sugar', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'onion powder', 'mustard powder', 'fresh lemon juice', 'worcestershire sauce', 'apple cider vinegar', 'light corn syrup', 'barbecue seasoning', 'paprika', 'sugar']",14,Portuguese word 'tempo' found in description,True,token,False

pancake day, or shrove tuesday, is the traditional feast day before the start of lent on ash wednesday. lent - the 40 days leading up to easter - was traditionally a time of fasting and on shrove tuesday christians went to confession and were ""shriven"" (absolved from their sins). it was the last opportunity to use eggs and fats before embarking on the lenten fast and pancakes are the perfect way of using up these ingredients. 
pancake tradition - a thin, flat cake, made of batter and baked on a griddle or fried in a pan, the pancake has a very long history and featured in cookbooks as far back as 1439. the tradition of tossing or flipping them is almost as old: ""and every man and maide doe take their turne, and tosse their pancakes up for feare they burne."" (pasquil's palin, 1619).
tossing pancakes -
certainly these days part of the fun of cooking pancakes is in the tossing. to toss a pancake successfully takes a combination of the perfect pancake and good technique - it's so easy to get it wrong and end up with half the pancake still stuck to the pan while the other half is stuck to the ceiling or floor. all in all, it's probably best to practise a few times without an audience.
pancake races - 
in the uk, pancake races also form an important part of the shrove tuesday celebrations - an opportunity for large numbers of people to race down the streets tossing pancakes.

frank cisneros says this is probably the most popular cocktail he's ever made; it was on the menu at gin palace in new york's east village for years. upon first taste, you'll see why it was such a crowd-pleaser. it's a sunny, warming drink, thanks to pineapple's heady tropical flavor and a spicy cinnamon simple syrup, all perked up with grapefruit, lime, and piney gin. 
 -- 
there's no need to get out a juicer for this; just muddle a 2- to 3-inch chunk of fresh pineapple and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into your measuring cup or jigger. this drink would be totally at home at a tiki party; you can multiply the recipe (and make fresh pineapple juice by whirring chopped fruit in your blender, then straining), but don't try to shake more than two drinks at a time.","['gin', 'cinnamon syrup', 'fresh pineapple juice', 'fresh lime juice', 'grapefruit juice', 'water', 'sugar', 'cinnamon sticks']",8,Portuguese word 'puleio' found in description,True,token,False

the pages are all frayed and dog-earred.  the recipes here are truly tried and tested -- comfort food at its best.  but first...a bit of info.  let's start with just what exactly is a griot.  pbs.org in it's study on blues in america defines a griot (pronounced 'gree oh') as a west african performer who perpetuates the oral traditions of a family, village, or leader by singing histories and tales. griots typically perform alone, accompanying themselves on a stringed instrument, and are considered by many musicologists a critical african root of the solo acoustic blues that developed among african american communities during the early 20th century.  en.wikipedia.org calls them wordsmiths who use poetry, proverbs, and rhythm to teach villagers about their history. their home is the territory of the mande peoples, i.e. the states of mali, gambia, guinea and senegal, where their tradition is alive to this day. ""griot"" is the french term for this class of musicians; the local terms are jeli in northern mande areas and jali in southern mande domains.  in the bambara and malinke 
languages ""djeli"" means ""griot"" and also ""blood"". in their inherited duty and vocation, the djeli are the life-blood of malian society. as oral historians, storytellers, singers and musicians, they keep the past in living contact with the present by acting as ajudicators, arbitrators, even match-makers. both men and women practice this vocation.  as you can guess, this is a very special cookbook and well-beloved in my house.  this book is now rare and extremely difficult to find.  it was compiled by american griots alice mcgill, mary carter washington and elmira m. 
washington, all well-known and familiar local names if you were born and bred in baltimore.  the book was created as a fund-raiser for the local jazz station, weaa broadcasting from the campus of morgan state university which is where i work.  with that background, i shall share the very first recipe that appears in the book...don't be afraid to read it through.  i promise you, it's worth it!","['elephant', 'salt and pepper', 'onion', 'elbow macaroni', 'rabbits']",5,Portuguese word 'ajudicators' found in description,True,token,False
