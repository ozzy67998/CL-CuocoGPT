""natalie from san francisco, ca on 05/23/06 

i love this recipe. one change i make is to use chicken thighs only, cook (boil in stock or saute) until they are about 95% done and then shred them when cool. i add the chicken at the last minute with the other ingredients so it finishes cooking in a couple of minutes. i find the dish is quicker, uses less oil and the spices get more evenly distributed. i usually use a sweeter dried fruit, like prunes or raisins, and a tart fruit, like apricots or cranberries. i've also made this dish with the larger size couscous (could be harder to find) as well as the traditional couscous and i find that the texture of the larger couscous is a nice addition.""","['chicken legs', 'ground cinnamon', 'ground ginger', 'olive oil', 'onion', 'dried fruit', 'low sodium chicken broth', 'couscous', 'of fresh mint']",9,True,keyword:description:nata

chili has a colorful history and is not a mexican dish at all. it has roots in spain and portugal where a meat stew with peppers was made. variations on this eventually made it to san antonio, tx which many boast as having the best chili and is the home to the beginning of the chili cookoff craze. tradition has it that true texas chili does not have beans. so this recipe does not include beans. you can vary the recipe by adding chopped tomato for a chunky rather than smooth stew.  serve with chopped jalapeno, cheddar cheese, and sliced green onion for garnish.

fresh sardines and mackerel are favorites in the portuguese cuisine and while fresh sardines are hard to find, mackerel are more readily available. usually made in midsummer, the grapes used are sour because they are in the middle of their growing season and are thus immature -- you can substitute mature grapes, unless you have a vineyard nearby!

the ingredients all speak of portugal: fish, olive oil, saffron, garlic, onion, grapes.

traditionally, this  is made in a casuela, an unglazed earthenware dish which will fry without burning ... you can substitute any heavy seasoned cast iron or non-stick pan. an unseasoned pan will ruin the wonderful cornmeal coating and skin of the fish ...

we had this recipe at a restaurant in the douro valley, but this version is from elisabeth luard's ""the food of spain and portugal"".
